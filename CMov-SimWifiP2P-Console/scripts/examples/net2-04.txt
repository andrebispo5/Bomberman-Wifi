#   Shows the effect of a GO (node B) destroying a group. The group has
#   two nodes: A is the client and B is the GO. There are two commit
#	steps. In the first step, both nodes are notified of their proximity and
#	connectivity. In the second step (after 5 seconds), node B leaves the
#   group and both nodes are notified of the change in network membership.
#   Nevertheless, they remain peers of each other.
