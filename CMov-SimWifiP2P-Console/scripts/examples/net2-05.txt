#   Shows the effect of a client (node B) leaving a group temporarily by
#   moving away from the GO (node A) until they stop seeing each other and
#   returning to the GO's range after a while. The client is reinserted in
#   the group. This procedure is done in three stages: first, the initial
#   group setup; second, B moves away; third, B rejoins the group.
