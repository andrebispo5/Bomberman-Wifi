#   Shows how to create a group consisting of two nodes and done in two
#   stages. First, they move to each other's range and are notified of 
#   their mutual presence. Second, they form a group: A is the GO, and B
#   is the client. There's a waiting period of 5 seconds between stages.
#	Note that after the second stage, in addition to the network membership
#	change event, node A is notified of the group ownership too, but not
#   node B.
