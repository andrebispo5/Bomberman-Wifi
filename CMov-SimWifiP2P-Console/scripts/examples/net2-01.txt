#   Shows how to create a group consisting of two nodes: A is the
#   GO and B is the client. Upon commit, both nodes will be able to
#   see each other (in range) and to talk to each other (in network).
#   The nodes will be notified of both events (proximity and 
#	connectivity) at the same time.
