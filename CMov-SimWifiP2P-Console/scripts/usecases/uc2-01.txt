#   Shows the effect of a GO (node A) leaving a group temporarily by
#   moving away from the other clients (nodes B and C) until the group
#	breaks. A new group will be formed between nodes B and C, B being the
#	GO node. Before A moves away, we introduce an iterative wait to give
#	the user the necessary time to advertise to the network that the group
#	will be dissolved. This could be done by allowing the user to press
#	a button, and the GO could initiate a goodbye protocol with the clients.
